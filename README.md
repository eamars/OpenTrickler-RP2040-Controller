## Pre-build firmware
[![Auto Build](https://github.com/eamars/OpenTrickler-RP2040-Controller/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/eamars/OpenTrickler-RP2040-Controller/actions/workflows/cmake.yml)

You can download the pre-built firmware based on the latest release from above link. Similar to flashing other RP2040 firmware, you need to put the Pico W into the bootloader mode by pressing BOOTSEL button and plug in the micro-USB cable. Then you can copy the .uf2 file from the package to the pico. Shortly after the Pico W will be programmed automatically. 



## Build OpenTrickler firmware from source

Reference: https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf

### Prerequistes  
[Git](https://gitforwindows.org/) and [Pico-SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-setup-windows/releases/download/v0.5.1/pico-setup-windows-x64-standalone.exe) are required to build the firmware. 
 
### Setting Up Firmware 
 Using Git Bash clone the repository   

    git clone https://github.com/eamars/OpenTrickler-RP2040-Controller

Next change to the cloned directory

    cd OpenTrickler-RP2040-Controller

Next use git to initalise the required submodules

    git submodule init

Now using git clone all submodules

    git submodule update --init --recursive
 

### Setting Up Libraries
Using the Pico-Developer window navigate to the cloned directory.
~~~javascript  
 cd Path:\to\cloned\repository
~~~  
Navigate to the build folder.
~~~javascript  
 cd build
~~~
Then run the following comand
~~~javascript  
cmake .. -DPICO_BOARD=pico_w -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
~~~
### Compiling the Firmware
Open Pico-VisualStudioCode and open the OpenTrickler-RP2040-Controller folder then navigate to the cmake plugin and click Build All Projects.
